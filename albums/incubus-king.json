  "description": "Miycho — Incubus King (Hyperpop)\n\nIncubus King is a high-energy hyperpop album where Miycho twists dark fantasy into electrified pop chaos. Glitchy synths, distorted vocals, blown-out bass, and sugary hooks collide to create a seductive yet aggressive soundscape. The incubus persona becomes a symbol of unapologetic confidence, desire, and digital-era power—beautiful, volatile, and untamed. Loud, fast, and addictive, the album thrives on excess, emotion, and transformation.\n"
